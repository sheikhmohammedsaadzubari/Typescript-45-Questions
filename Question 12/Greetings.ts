// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names : string[] = ['Maaz' ,'Saad' , 'Saleem' , 'Anus' , 'Saba' ,'Saher' , 'Abdul Rehman' , 'Umer' , 'Momina' , 'Ayesha'];


    //Loop to print each person's personalize message

for (let name of names){

    //Print a personalize message for each friends.
    
    console.log(`Assalam Alaikum ${name}!  \n  I hope you are having a fantastic day.`);
}
